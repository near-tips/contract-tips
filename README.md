<!-- MAGIC COMMENT: DO NOT DELETE! Everything above this line is hidden on NEAR Examples page -->

This smart contract saves and records the status messages of NEAR accounts that call it.

Windows users: please visit the [Windows-specific README file](README-Windows.md).

## Prerequisites
Ensure `near-cli` is installed by running:

```
near --version
```

If needed, install `near-cli`:

```
npm install near-cli -g
```

Ensure `Rust` is installed by running:

```
rustc --version
```

If needed, install `Rust`:

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Quick Start
To run this project locally:

1. Prerequisites: Make sure you have Node.js â‰¥ 12 installed (https://nodejs.org), then use it to install yarn: `npm install --global yarn` (or just `npm i -g yarn`)
2. Run the local development server: `yarn && yarn dev` (see package.json for a full list of scripts you can run with yarn)
Now you'll have a local development environment backed by the NEAR TestNet! Running yarn dev will tell you the URL you can visit in your browser to see the app.

## Building this contract
To make the build process compatible with multiple operating systems, the build process exists as a script in `package.json`.
There are a number of special flags used to compile the smart contract into the wasm file.
Run this command to build and place the wasm file in the `res` directory:
```bash
npm run build
```

**Note**: Instead of `npm`, users of [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) may run:
```bash
yarn build
```

### Important
If you encounter an error similar to:
>note: the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target may not be installed

Then run:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## Testing
To test run:
```bash
cargo test --package status-message -- --nocapture
```
